# GitHub Portfolio

This project is a **dynamic portfolio page** that showcases my GitHub profile and featured repositories. It uses the **GitHub REST API** to fetch profile information and repository statistics in real-time, and displays them in a visually appealing card layout.

## How It Works

1. The page loads and executes `app.js`.
2. `app.js` fetches your GitHub profile info using the API endpoint:  
   `https://api.github.com/users/{username}`
3. Then it fetches your featured repositories using:  
   `https://api.github.com/repos/{username}/{repo}`
4. Each repository is displayed in a card with its information and relevant icons.
5. Screenshots can optionally be included, but currently replaced with emoji icons for simplicity.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krVVisty/Portfolio.git
